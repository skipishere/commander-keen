# What is this?
An early attempt to recreate the original Command Keen (Episode 1) using the Godot engine. What better way to learn to make a game then to try and recreate an old one.
This project uses some custom music and sound effects ([see credits](https://github.com/skipishere/commander-keen/blob/main/credits.md) for what and where) as the original didn't have music, and the PC speaker sound effects are not the nicest & hard to get decent versions of.

# Why?
I wanted to learn how to make a game in Godot. I figured it would be fun to try and recreate one of the first games I played as a kid and this seemed like a good way to do it.
This repository is also used to experiment with Copilot, Docker and GitHub features to allow me to better understand how I can better use them in my day to day work.

# Prerequisites
- [Godot 4.4.1 .Net version](https://godotengine.org/download/windows/)
- [.NET 8 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/8.0)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) (optional, if you just want to build the game in a container and not install Godot or .NET)

# How to build
See [BUILD.md](https://github.com/skipishere/commander-keen/blob/main/BUILD.md) which contains information on how the automated release build system works and how you can build the game yourself with just the source code and Docker.

## Useful resources:
Credits for music, sound effects and fonts used in the game and links to the original sources are available in [credits.md](credits.md).

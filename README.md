# What is this?
An early attempt to recreate the original Command Keen (Episode 1) using the Godot engine. What better way to learn to make a game then to try and recreate an old one.
This project uses some custom music and sound effects ([see credits](https://github.com/skipishere/commander-keen/blob/main/credits.md) for what and where) as the original didn't have music, and the PC speaker sound effects are not the nicest & hard to get decent versions of.

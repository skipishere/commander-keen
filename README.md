# What is this?
An early attempt to recreate the original Command Keen (Episode 1) using the Godot engine. What better way to learn to make a game then to try and recreate an old one.

Things that need to be worked on:
 - [ ] Hazards - currently Keen can't die
 - [ ] Enemies/Creatures
   - [ ] Vorticons
   - [ ] Gargs
   - [ ] Tank Robot
   - [ ] Butler robot
   - [ ] Yorp
